# Cope and Drag (CnD)

CnD is a midpoint between the default visualizer and full, domain-specific custom visualization. CnD gives users much more control over the default kind of visualization. One example might be a model of binary search trees: the default visualizer is free to lay out nodes so that left children go to the _right_ and right children go to the _left_ (or, worse, some mix of the two). In CnD, we can express that left means left, and right means right. 

To use CnD, go to the Layout tab in sterling and click "Load Layout". (Don't worry about pasting in anything here, the CnD interface is generally easier to work with directly.)

For more information on how to use CnD, see [the latest CnD docs](https://sidprasad.github.io/copeanddrag/).
