# Expressions

Given an instance, _expressions_ in Forge evaluate to sets of atoms. 

## Froglet 

In Froglet, expressions must always denote a single atom or the empty set (`none`). This matches the abstraction where fields are always either total (`one`, `func`) or partial (`lone`, `pfunc`) functions.
