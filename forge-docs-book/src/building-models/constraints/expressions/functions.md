# Functions

In the same way that predicates define reusable constraints, _functions_ define reusable expressions. Define functions with the `fun` keyword:

```
fun <fun-name>[<args>]: <result-type> {
   <expr>
}
```

~~~admonish example title="Helper function"
```
fun inLawA[p: Person]: one Person {
  p.spouse.parent1
}
```
~~~

As with predicates, arguments will be evaluated via substitution. Functions may be used (with appropriate arguments) anywhere expressions can appear.

~~~admonish example title="Helper function use"
```
all p: Person | some inLawA[p]
```

This expands to:

```
all p: Person | some (p.spouse.parent1)
```
