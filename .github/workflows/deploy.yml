# NOTE: `gh-pages` branch was replaced w/ `deployed-pages` b/c GitHub
# had an un-removeable default GHAction on branch "gh-pages" that
# over-wrote pushes from the main branch's deploy action (this script)

# Another note- I wish .yml had ability to have variables to avoid
# hardcoding the "forge-docs-book" directory and branch name "deployed-pages"
